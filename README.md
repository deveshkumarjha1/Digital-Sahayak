## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- Python 3.8+
- npm or yarn

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_cashfree_app_id
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_cashfree_secret
```

## Pages & Routes

- **Home**: Landing page with scheme and job highlights
- **Login/Register**: User authentication
- **Yojana Page**: Browse government schemes
- **Jobs Page**: View available job listings
- **Job Details**: Detailed job information with AI matching
- **Dashboard**: User dashboard with recommendations
- **Admin Page**: Content management for schemes and jobs
- **Profile**: User profile and preferences

## Development Notes

- The project uses Context API for state management (Authentication)
- UI components are built with Shadcn and styled with Tailwind CSS
- Backend provides RESTful endpoints for data management
- **Digital Sahayak AI**: Custom-built matching engine with rule-based + ML hybrid approach
- **Self-Learning System**: Learns from user behavior (applications, interactions) to improve recommendations
- Modular architecture for scalability and maintainability

## Digital Sahayak AI System

Our custom-built **Digital Sahayak AI** is developed from scratch and includes:

### 🤖 Hybrid Matching Engine
- **Rule-based Matching**: Deterministic field mappings (education, age, state, category)
- **Heuristic Scoring**: Pattern-based matching with learned weights
- **Log-based Learning**: Learns from user behavior (applications, saves, ignores)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides match confidence with explanations in Hindi & English

### 📋 Form Intelligence
- **Field Classification**: Auto-detects form field types (name, email, Aadhar, PAN, etc.)
- **Error Prediction**: Validates forms before submission
- **Smart Auto-fill**: Suggests values based on user profile
- **Portal Training**: Learns from portal-specific form datasets

### 📊 Continuous Learning
- Tracks user interactions (applied, ignored, saved jobs/schemes)
- Updates matching patterns based on successful applications
- Improves recommendations over time
- No dependency on external AI APIs - built completely in-house

See [REFACTORING_GUIDE.md](backend/REFACTORING_GUIDE.md) and [FORM_INTELLIGENCE_GUIDE.md](backend/FORM_INTELLIGENCE_GUIDE.md) for detailed documentation.

**📖 Complete AI Documentation:** See [DIGITAL_SAHAYAK_AI.md](DIGITAL_SAHAYAK_AI.md) for how our custom AI works without external dependencies.
